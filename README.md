## Formulas
- **Expected value of geometric distribution** (expected number of Bernoulli trials before a success, where $p$ is the probability of a single success):
  - $1\over p$
- **Sum of arithemtic sequence**:
  - $n\times{({a_1+a_n})\over{2}}$
  - ${n\over2}\times{[2a_1 + (n-1)\times d]}$
  - Where:
    - $a_1 =$ first term
    - $d =$ common difference
    - $n =$ number of terms in the range
